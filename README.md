# particle

## The vision

A monorepo manager handling just the

- organization
- orchestration

Some key pillars `particle` aims to uphold,

- The larger the codebase gets shouldn't compromise the speed of operations of the repository
- Encourage layered reuse without spaghetti library consumption
- A project within the repo can be added immediately be working autonomously and productively
- An incremental upgrade system for both internal and external libraries
- Hot fixing past deployments is totally possible
- Libraries developed in the repo can both either work towards a release to their internal consumers or have immediate consumption
